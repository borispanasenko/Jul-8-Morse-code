A lightweight Flask-based API that encodes and decodes alphanumeric text into Morse code and vice versa. 
The service handles standard characters as well as prosigns like SOS and AR, with robust input validation and clear error handling. 
Designed with clean separation of concerns, informative error messages, and full test coverage using pytest. This project demonstrates attention 
to edge cases, API design best practices, and defensive programming â€” even in simple tasks.
